# *My remote Job*

Welcome to My Remote Job!

This project was born from the need to find remote jobs, mainly in Brazil.

It takes a long time to navigate between many sites to get new information about the job, and particularly, I don't like subscribing to mailing lists, newsletters and things like that.

So I decided to create an application where I could see the opportunities open in the same format with the same information on the same screen.

For now, this app shows jobs from the following sources:

[GeekHunter](https://www.geekhunter.com.br "GeekHunter")

[Hipsters Jobs](http://hipsters.jobs "Hipsters Jobs")

[StackOverflow Jobs](https://stackoverflow.com/jobs "StackOverflow")

#### Notes:
- These sources offer many job opportunities, but "My Remote Job" accepts _*remote*_  jobs only. 

- Depending on when you're running these projects, the Crawlers can be broken dude to sources changes. If it's happening still free to open an Issue or a PR.
